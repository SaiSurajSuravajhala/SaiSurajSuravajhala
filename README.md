# **Hi I'm Sai Suraj Suravajhala** 

I’m an **AI/ML Engineer** passionate about building intelligent systems and end-to-end data solutions. My experience spans **multi-agent AI** architectures, **ETL pipelines**, and **MLOps**—from designing scalable data ingestion workflows to deploying ML models in production. I’ve developed AI-powered document search systems, containerized ML applications, and orchestrated decentralized AI environments (including a **1st place** finish at the MIT Decentralized AI Hackathon).

**Key Highlights:**
- **AI Agents & MLOps:** Built multi-agent frameworks integrating financial analysis and web search tools.
- **Scalable Pipelines:** Created ETL processes with Azure Data Factory, Talend, and Airflow, handling millions of records daily.
- **Model Deployment:** Proficient in Docker, and CI/CD automation, ensuring seamless cloud integration.
- **LLMs & Embeddings:** Leveraged LangChain, Pinecone, and GPT models to power advanced semantic search and Q&A.
- **Data Visualization & Insights:** Delivered dashboards using Tableau and Power BI, enabling data-driven decisions.

When I’m not exploring AI and data engineering, I enjoy Swimming, reading novels, playing badminton and snooker, and experimenting in the kitchen. I’m always excited to collaborate on innovative AI/ML projects—let’s connect!
